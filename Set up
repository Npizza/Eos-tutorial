  @1:The wallet will protect these keys when it's locked. Accessing the keys in a locked wallet requires the master password that
  was provided to you during wallet creation. Because the wallet file itself is encrypted, it's not required to backup your
  keypairs, but backing up your wallet file in a safe place is highly recommended.
